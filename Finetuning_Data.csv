"llc: fix info leak via getsockname()

The LLC code wrongly returns 0, i.e. ""success"", when the socket is

sys_getsockname this leads to an arbitrary memory leak of up to 128
bytes kernel stack via the getsockname() syscall.

Return an error instead when the socket is zapped to prevent the info
leak. Also remove the unnecessary memset(0). We don't directly write to
the memory pointed by uaddr but memcpy() a local structure at the end of
the function that is properly initialized.

"dm snapshot: fix data corruption

This patch fixes a particular type of data corruption that has been
encountered when loading a snapshot's metadata from disk.

When we allocate a new chunk in persistent_prepare, we increment
ps->next_free and we make sure that it doesn't point to a metadata area
by further incrementing it if necessary.

When we load metadata from disk on device activation, ps->next_free is
positioned after the last used data chunk. However, if this last used
data chunk is followed by a metadata area, ps->next_free is positioned
erroneously to the metadata area. A newly-allocated chunk is placed at
the same location as the metadata area, resulting in data or metadata
corruption.

This patch changes the code so that ps->next_free skips the metadata
area when metadata are loaded in function read_exceptions.

The patch also moves a piece of code from persistent_prepare_exception
to a separate function skip_metadata to avoid code duplication.

"netfilter: nf_nat: fix access to uninitialized buffer in IRC NAT helper

Commit 5901b6be885e attempted to introduce IPv6 support into
IRC NAT helper. By doing so, the following code seemed to be removed
by accident:

  ip = ntohl(exp->master->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY].tuple.dst.u3.ip);
  sprintf(buffer, ""%u %u"", ip, port);
  pr_debug(""nf_nat_irc: inserting '%s' == %pI4, port %u\n"", buffer, &ip, port);

This leads to the fact that buffer[] was left uninitialized and
contained some stack value. When we call nf_nat_mangle_tcp_packet(),
we call strlen(buffer) on excatly this uninitialized buffer. If we
are unlucky and the skb has enough tailroom, we overwrite resp. leak
contents with values that sit on our stack into the packet and send
that out to the receiver.

Since the rather informal DCC spec [1] does not seem to specify
IPv6 support right now, we log such occurences so that admins can
act accordingly, and drop the packet. I've looked into XChat source,
and IPv6 is not supported there: addresses are in u32 and print
via %u format string.

Therefore, restore old behaviour as in IPv4, use snprintf(). The
IRC helper does not support IPv6 by now. By this, we can safely use
strlen(buffer) in nf_nat_mangle_tcp_packet() and prevent a buffer
overflow. Also simplify some code as we now have ct variable anyway.

scenario if client B receives a write delegation from the NFS server:

Client A:

Client B:

"Fix potential security leak in HashContext

Summary: CVE-2014-6229

This is not a NUL-terminated string, it's a fixed-size block of data.
The risks were key truncation (if there happens to be a NUL byte in the
key) or over-reading (which would be information leakage).

"mac80211: fix fragmentation code, particularly for encryption

The ""new"" fragmentation code (since my rewrite almost 5 years ago)
erroneously sets skb->len rather than using skb_trim() to adjust
the length of the first fragment after copying out all the others.
This leaves the skb tail pointer pointing to after where the data
originally ended, and thus causes the encryption MIC to be written
at that point, rather than where it belongs: immediately after the
data.

The impact of this is that if software encryption is done, then
 a) encryption doesn't work for the first fragment, the connection
    becomes unusable as the first fragment will never be properly
    verified at the receiver, the MIC is practically guaranteed to
    be wrong
 b) we leak up to 8 bytes of plaintext (!) of the packet out into
    the air

This is only mitigated by the fact that many devices are capable
of doing encryption in hardware, in which case this can't happen
as the tail pointer is irrelevant in that case. Additionally,
fragmentation is not used very frequently and would normally have
to be configured manually.

Fix this by using skb_trim() properly.

"sched: Fix information leak in sys_sched_getattr()

We're copying the on-stack structure to userspace, but forgot to give
the right number of bytes to copy. This allows the calling process to
obtain up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from the stack (and possibly adjacent
kernel memory).

This fix copies only as much as we actually have on the stack
(attr->size defaults to the size of the struct) and leaves the rest of
the userspace-provided buffer untouched.

Found using kmemcheck + trinity.

"mnt: Update detach_mounts to leave mounts connected

Now that it is possible to lazily unmount an entire mount tree and
leave the individual mounts connected to each other add a new flag
UMOUNT_CONNECTED to umount_tree to force this behavior and use
this flag in detach_mounts.

This closes a bug where the deletion of a file or directory could
trigger an unmount and reveal data under a mount point.

"wizard: fix save users changes after reviewing dump dir files

If the user reviewed the dump dir's files during reporting the crash, the
changes was thrown away and original data was passed to the bugzilla bug
report.

report-gtk saves the first text view buffer and then reloads data from the
reported problem directory, which causes that the changes made to those text
views are thrown away.

Function save_text_if_changed(), except of saving text, also reload the files
from dump dir and update gui state from the dump dir. The commit moves the
reloading and updating gui functions away from this function.

"md: use kzalloc() when bitmap is disabled

In drivers/md/md.c get_bitmap_file() uses kmalloc() for creating a
mdu_bitmap_file_t called ""file"".

5769         file = kmalloc(sizeof(*file), GFP_NOIO);
5770         if (!file)
5771                 return -ENOMEM;

This structure is copied to user space at the end of the function.

5787             copy_to_user(arg, file, sizeof(*file)))
5788                 err = -EFAULT

But if bitmap is disabled only the first byte of ""file"" is initialized
with zero, so it's possible to read some bytes (up to 4095) of kernel
space memory from user space. This is an information leak.

5775         /* bitmap disabled, zero the first byte and copy out */

"Btrfs: fix truncation of compressed and inlined extents

When truncating a file to a smaller size which consists of an inline
extent that is compressed, we did not discard (or made unusable) the
data between the new file size and the old file size, wasting metadata
space and allowing for the truncated data to be leaked and the data
corruption/loss mentioned below.
We were also not correctly decrementing the number of bytes used by the
inode, we were setting it to zero, giving a wrong report for callers of
the stat(2) syscall. The fsck tool also reported an error about a mismatch
between the nbytes of the file versus the real space used by the file.

Now because we weren't discarding the truncated region of the file, it
was possible for a caller of the clone ioctl to actually read the data
that was truncated, allowing for a security breach without requiring root
access to the system, using only standard filesystem operations. The
scenario is the following:

   1) User A creates a file which consists of an inline and compressed
      extent with a size of 2000 bytes - the file is not accessible to
      any other users (no read, write or execution permission for anyone
      else);

   2) The user truncates the file to a size of 1000 bytes;

   3) User A makes the file world readable;

   4) User B creates a file consisting of an inline extent of 2000 bytes;

   5) User B issues a clone operation from user A's file into its own
      file (using a length argument of 0, clone the whole range);

   6) User B now gets to see the 1000 bytes that user A truncated from
      its file before it made its file world readbale. User B also lost
      the bytes in the range [1000, 2000[ bytes from its own file, but
      that might be ok if his/her intention was reading stale data from
      user A that was never supposed to be public.

Note that this contrasts with the case where we truncate a file from 2000
bytes to 1000 bytes and then truncate it back from 1000 to 2000 bytes. In
this case reading any byte from the range [1000, 2000[ will return a value
of 0x00, instead of the original data.

This problem exists since the clone ioctl was added and happens both with
and without my recent data loss and file corruption fixes for the clone
ioctl (patch ""Btrfs: fix file corruption and data loss after cloning
inline extents"").

So fix this by truncating the compressed inline extents as we do for the
non-compressed case, which involves decompressing, if the data isn't already
in the page cache, compressing the truncated version of the extent, writing
the compressed content into the inline extent and then truncate it.

The following test case for fstests reproduces the problem. In order for
the test to pass both this fix and my previous fix for the clone ioctl
that forbids cloning a smaller inline extent into a larger one,
which is titled ""Btrfs: fix file corruption and data loss after cloning
inline extents"", are needed. Without that other fix the test fails in a
different way that does not leak the truncated data, instead part of
destination file gets replaced with zeroes (because the destination file
has a larger inline extent than the source).

  # Now truncate our file foo to a smaller size. Because it consists of a
  # compressed and inline extent, btrfs did not shrink the inline extent to the
  # new size (if the extent was not compressed, btrfs would shrink it to 128
  # bytes), it only updates the inode's i_size to 128 bytes.
  $XFS_IO_PROG -c ""truncate 128"" $SCRATCH_MNT/foo

  # Now clone foo's inline extent into bar.
  # This clone operation should fail with errno EOPNOTSUPP because the source
  # file consists only of an inline extent and the file's size is smaller than
  # the inline extent of the destination (128 bytes < 256 bytes). However the
  # clone ioctl was not prepared to deal with a file that has a size smaller
  # than the size of its inline extent (something that happens only for compressed
  # inline extents), resulting in copying the full inline extent from the source
  # file into the destination file.
  #
  # Note that btrfs' clone operation for inline extents consists of removing the
  # inline extent from the destination inode and copy the inline extent from the
  # source inode into the destination inode, meaning that if the destination
  # inode's inline extent is larger (N bytes) than the source inode's inline
  # extent (M bytes), some bytes (N - M bytes) will be lost from the destination
  # file. Btrfs could copy the source inline extent's data into the destination's
  # inline extent so that we would not lose any data, but that's currently not
  # done due to the complexity that would be needed to deal with such cases
  # (specially when one or both extents are compressed), returning EOPNOTSUPP, as
  # it's normally not a very common case to clone very small files (only case
  # where we get inline extents) and copying inline extents does not save any
  # space (unlike for normal, non-inlined extents).
  $CLONER_PROG -s 0 -d 0 -l 0 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo $SCRATCH_MNT/bar

  # Now because the above clone operation used to succeed, and due to foo's inline
  # extent not being shinked by the truncate operation, our file bar got the whole
  # inline extent copied from foo, making us lose the last 128 bytes from bar
  # which got replaced by the bytes in range [128, 256[ from foo before foo was
  # truncated - in other words, data loss from bar and being able to read old and
  # stale data from foo that should not be possible to read anymore through normal
  # filesystem operations. Contrast with the case where we truncate a file from a
  # size N to a smaller size M, truncate it back to size N and then read the range
  # [M, N[, we should always get the value 0x00 for all the bytes in that range.

  # We expected the clone operation to fail with errno EOPNOTSUPP and therefore
  # not modify our file's bar data/metadata. So its content should be 256 bytes
  # long with all bytes having the value 0xbb.
  #
  # Without the btrfs bug fix, the clone operation succeeded and resulted in
  # leaking truncated data from foo, the bytes that belonged to its range
  # [128, 256[, and losing data from bar in that same range. So reading the
  # file gave us the following content:
  #
  # 0000000 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1
  # *
  # 0000200 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a
  # *
  # 0000400
  echo ""File bar's content after the clone operation:""
  od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/bar

  # Also because the foo's inline extent was not shrunk by the truncate
  # operation, btrfs' fsck, which is run by the fstests framework everytime a
  # test completes, failed reporting the following error:
  #
  #  root 5 inode 257 errors 400, nbytes wrong

"arm64: dma-mapping: always clear allocated buffers

Buffers allocated by dma_alloc_coherent() are always zeroed on Alpha,
ARM (32bit), MIPS, PowerPC, x86/x86_64 and probably other architectures.
It turned out that some drivers rely on this 'feature'. Allocated buffer
might be also exposed to userspace with dma_mmap() call, so clearing it
is desired from security point of view to avoid exposing random memory
to userspace. This patch unifies dma_alloc_coherent() behavior on ARM64
architecture with other implementations by unconditionally zeroing
allocated buffer.

"tty: Fix unsafe ldisc reference via ioctl(TIOCGETD)

ioctl(TIOCGETD) retrieves the line discipline id directly from the
ldisc because the line discipline id (c_line) in termios is untrustworthy;
userspace may have set termios via ioctl(TCSETS*) without actually
changing the line discipline via ioctl(TIOCSETD).

However, directly accessing the current ldisc via tty->ldisc is
unsafe; the ldisc ptr dereferenced may be stale if the line discipline
is changing via ioctl(TIOCSETD) or hangup.

Wait for the line discipline reference (just like read() or write())
to retrieve the ""current"" line discipline id.

"bpf: fix branch offset adjustment on backjumps after patching ctx expansion

When ctx access is used, the kernel often needs to expand/rewrite
instructions, so after that patching, branch offsets have to be
adjusted for both forward and backward jumps in the new eBPF program,
but for backward jumps it fails to account the delta. Meaning, for
example, if the expansion happens exactly on the insn that sits at
the jump target, it doesn't fix up the back jump offset.

Analysis on what the check in adjust_branches() is currently doing:

  /* adjust offset of jmps if necessary */
  if (i < pos && i + insn->off + 1 > pos)
    insn->off += delta;
  else if (i > pos && i + insn->off + 1 < pos)
    insn->off -= delta;

First condition (forward jumps):

  Before:                         After:

  insns[0]                        insns[0]
  insns[1] <--- i/insn            insns[1] <--- i/insn
  insns[2] <--- pos               insns[P] <--- pos
  insns[3]                        insns[P]  `------| delta
  insns[4] <--- target_X          insns[P]   `-----|
  insns[5]                        insns[3]
                                  insns[4] <--- target_X
                                  insns[5]

First case is if we cross pos-boundary and the jump instruction was
before pos. This is handeled correctly. I.e. if i == pos, then this
would mean our jump that we currently check was the patchlet itself
that we just injected. Since such patchlets are self-contained and
have no awareness of any insns before or after the patched one, the
delta is correctly not adjusted. Also, for the second condition in
case of i + insn->off + 1 == pos, means we jump to that newly patched
instruction, so no offset adjustment are needed. That part is correct.

Second condition (backward jumps):

  Before:                         After:

  insns[0]                        insns[0]
  insns[1] <--- target_X          insns[1] <--- target_X
  insns[2] <--- pos <-- target_Y  insns[P] <--- pos <-- target_Y
  insns[3]                        insns[P]  `------| delta
  insns[4] <--- i/insn            insns[P]   `-----|

Second interesting case is where we cross pos-boundary and the jump
instruction was after pos. Backward jump with i == pos would be
impossible and pose a bug somewhere in the patchlet, so the first
condition checking i > pos is okay only by itself. However, i +
insn->off + 1 < pos does not always work as intended to trigger the
adjustment. It works when jump targets would be far off where the
delta wouldn't matter. But, for example, where the fixed insn->off
before pointed to pos (target_Y), it now points to pos + delta, so
that additional room needs to be taken into account for the check.
This means that i) both tests here need to be adjusted into pos + delta,
and ii) for the second condition, the test needs to be <= as pos
itself can be a target in the backjump, too.

Payloads of NM entries are not supposed to contain NUL.  When we run

but what we return as the total length is the sum of *claimed*

large - not unlimited, since you'd need to put CE entries in
between to be able to get more than the maximum that could be
contained in one isofs directory entry / continuation chunk and

"tcp: make challenge acks less predictable

Yue Cao claims that current host rate limiting of challenge ACKS
(RFC 5961) could leak enough information to allow a patient attacker
to hijack TCP sessions. He will soon provide details in an academic
paper.

This patch increases the default limit from 100 to 1000, and adds
some randomization so that the attacker can no longer hijack
sessions without spending a considerable amount of probes.

Based on initial analysis and patch from Linus.

Note that we also have per socket rate limiting, so it is tempting
to remove the host limit in the future.

v2: randomize the count of challenge acks per second, not the period.

The calculation in nlmsg_len() underflows if 'nlh->nlmsg_len <

trigger an out-of-bound read.

If the length validation does fail then the malformed batch message is
copied back to userspace. However, we cannot do this because the
nlh->nlmsg_len can be invalid. This leads to an out-of-bounds read in

"KVM: x86: drop error recovery in em_jmp_far and em_ret_far

em_jmp_far and em_ret_far assumed that setting IP can only fail in 64
bit mode, but syzkaller proved otherwise (and SDM agrees).
Code segment was restored upon failure, but it was left uninitialized
outside of long mode, which could lead to a leak of host kernel stack.
We could have fixed that by always saving and restoring the CS, but we
take a simpler approach and just break any guest that manages to fail
as the error recovery is error-prone and modern CPUs don't need emulator
for this.

"ALSA: timer: Fix race between read and ioctl

The read from ALSA timer device, the function snd_timer_user_tread(),
may access to an uninitialized struct snd_timer_user fields when the
read is concurrently performed while the ioctl like
snd_timer_user_tselect() is invoked.  We have already fixed the races
among ioctls via a mutex, but we seem to have forgotten the race
between read vs ioctl.

This patch simply applies (more exactly extends the already applied
range of) tu->ioctl_lock in snd_timer_user_tread() for closing the

"Sanitize 'move_pages()' permission checks

The 'move_paghes()' system call was introduced long long ago with the
same permission checks as for sending a signal (except using
CAP_SYS_NICE instead of CAP_SYS_KILL for the overriding capability).

That turns out to not be a great choice - while the system call really
only moves physical page allocations around (and you need other
capabilities to do a lot of it), you can check the return value to map
out some the virtual address choices and defeat ASLR of a binary that
still shares your uid.

So change the access checks to the more common 'ptrace_may_access()'
model instead.

This tightens the access checks for the uid, and also effectively
changes the CAP_SYS_NICE check to CAP_SYS_PTRACE, but it's unlikely that
anybody really _uses_ this legacy system call any more (we hav ebetter
NUMA placement models these days), so I expect nobody to notice.

Famous last words.

"mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb ranges

This matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace.  It is
probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
tested that.

Removing the `walk->hugetlb_entry` condition in walk_hugetlb_range() has
no effect because the caller already checks for that.

This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
a hugetlb_entry callback.

This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.

"fix a fencepost error in pipe_advance()

The logics in pipe_advance() used to release all buffers past the new
position failed in cases when the number of buffers to release was equal
to pipe->buffers.  If that happened, none of them had been released,
leaving pipe full.  Worse, it was trivial to trigger and we end up with
pipe full of uninitialized pages.  IOW, it's an infoleak.

"ext4: fix data exposure after a crash

Huang has reported that in his powerfail testing he is seeing stale
block contents in some of recently allocated blocks although he mounts
ext4 in data=ordered mode. After some investigation I have found out
that indeed when delayed allocation is used, we don't add inode to
transaction's list of inodes needing flushing before commit. Originally
we were doing that but commit f3b59291a69d removed the logic with a
flawed argument that it is not needed.

The problem is that although for delayed allocated blocks we write their
contents immediately after allocating them, there is no guarantee that
the IO scheduler or device doesn't reorder things and thus transaction
allocating blocks and attaching them to inode can reach stable storage
before actual block contents. Actually whenever we attach freshly
allocated blocks to inode using a written extent, we should add inode to
transaction's ordered inode list to make sure we properly wait for block
contents to be written before committing the transaction. So that is
what we do in this patch. This also handles other cases where stale data
exposure was possible - like filling hole via mmap in
data=ordered,nodelalloc mode.

The only exception to the above rule are extending direct IO writes where
blkdev_direct_IO() waits for IO to complete before increasing i_size and
thus stale data exposure is not possible. For now we don't complicate
the code with optimizing this special case since the overhead is pretty
low. In case this is observed to be a performance problem we can always
handle it using a special flag to ext4_map_blocks().

"bpf: don't let ldimm64 leak map addresses on unprivileged

The patch fixes two things at once:

1) It checks the env->allow_ptr_leaks and only prints the map address to
   the log if we have the privileges to do so, otherwise it just dumps 0
   as we would when kptr_restrict is enabled on %pK. Given the latter is
   off by default and not every distro sets it, I don't want to rely on
   this, hence the 0 by default for unprivileged.

2) Printing of ldimm64 in the verifier log is currently broken in that
   we don't print the full immediate, but only the 32 bit part of the
   first insn part for ldimm64. Thus, fix this up as well; it's okay to
   access, since we verified all ldimm64 earlier already (including just
   constants) through replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr().

When vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl() is called with an existing buffer,

second, when a user-provided buffer is found, we will use the

"avformat/hls: Check local file extensions

This reduces the attack surface of local file-system
information leaking.

It prevents the existing exploit leading to an information leak. As
well as similar hypothetical attacks.

Leaks of information from files and symlinks ending in common multimedia extensions
are still possible. But files with sensitive information like private keys and passwords
generally do not use common multimedia filename extensions.
It does not stop leaks via remote addresses in the LAN.

The existing exploit depends on a specific decoder as well.
It does appear though that the exploit should be possible with any decoder.
The problem is that as long as sensitive information gets into the decoder,
the output of the decoder becomes sensitive as well.
The only obvious solution is to prevent access to sensitive information. Or to
disable hls or possibly some of its feature. More complex solutions like
checking the path to limit access to only subdirectories of the hls path may
work as an alternative. But such solutions are fragile and tricky to implement
portably and would not stop every possible attack nor would they work with all
valid hls files.

Developers have expressed their dislike / objected to disabling hls by default as well
as disabling hls with local files. There also where objections against restricting
remote url file extensions. This here is a less robust but also lower
inconvenience solution.
It can be applied stand alone or together with other solutions.
limiting the check to local files was suggested by nevcairiel

This recommits the security fix without the author name joke which was
originally requested by Nicolas.

"x86/paravirt: Fix spectre-v2 mitigations for paravirt guests

Nadav reported that on guests we're failing to rewrite the indirect
calls to CALLEE_SAVE paravirt functions. In particular the
pv_queued_spin_unlock() call is left unpatched and that is all over the
place. This obviously wrecks Spectre-v2 mitigation (for paravirt
guests) which relies on not actually having indirect calls around.

The reason is an incorrect clobber test in paravirt_patch_call(); this
function rewrites an indirect call with a direct call to the _SAME_
function, there is no possible way the clobbers can be different
because of this.

Therefore remove this clobber check. Also put WARNs on the other patch
failure case (not enough room for the instruction) which I've not seen
trigger in my (limited) testing.

Three live kernel image disassemblies for lock_sock_nested (as a small
function that illustrates the problem nicely). PRE is the current
situation for guests, POST is with this patch applied and NATIVE is with
or without the patch for !guests.

"fbdev: Fixing arbitrary kernel leak in case FBIOGETCMAP_SPARC in sbusfb_ioctl_helper().

Fixing arbitrary kernel leak in case FBIOGETCMAP_SPARC in
sbusfb_ioctl_helper().

'index' is defined as an int in sbusfb_ioctl_helper().
We retrieve this from the user:
if (get_user(index, &c->index) ||
    __get_user(count, &c->count) ||
    __get_user(ured, &c->red) ||
    __get_user(ugreen, &c->green) ||
    __get_user(ublue, &c->blue))
       return -EFAULT;

and then we use 'index' in the following way:
red = cmap->red[index + i] >> 8;
green = cmap->green[index + i] >> 8;
blue = cmap->blue[index + i] >> 8;

This is a classic information leak vulnerability. 'index' should be

This patch is straight-forward; it changes 'index' to unsigned int
in two switch-cases: FBIOGETCMAP_SPARC && FBIOPUTCMAP_SPARC.

This patch fixes CVE-2018-6412.

"EAP-pwd: fix side-channel leak where 1 in 2018 handshakes fail

Previously the Hunting and Pecking algorithm of EAP-pwd aborted when
more than 10 iterations are needed. Every iteration has a 50% chance
of finding the password element. This means one in every 2048 handshakes
will fail, in which case an error frame is sent to the client. This
event leaks information that can be abused in an offline password
brute-force attack. More precisely, the adversary learns that all 10
iterations failed for the given random EAP-pwd token. Using the same
techniques as in the Dragonblood attack, this can be used to brute-force
the password.

This patch fixes the above issue by executing enough iterations such that
the password element is always found eventually.

Note that timing and cache leaks remain a risk against the current
implementation of EAP-pwd.","{'added': [(195, '\t\tif (ctr > 100) {')], 'deleted': [(195, '\t\tif (ctr > 10) {')]}"

"Fix source code disclosure on case-insensitive file systems

If the file system containing the PHP code is case-insensitive, a
request containing an uppercase file extension will return the
contents of the PHP file to the browser instead of executing it.

E.g. a request for this URL will return the source code:

  https:/sp.example.org/simplesaml/module.php/core/frontpage_welcome.PHP

Fix that by converting the path to lowercase before checking the file
extension.

See the following page for details:
